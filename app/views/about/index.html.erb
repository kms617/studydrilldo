<h1>About</h1>
<hl>
<p>Toy is a learning and productivity tool with two main features:<p>
<ul>
<li>It integrates a common lesson-planning methodology to optimize study by checking how you study (the allocation of the different tasks you use to study) against an ideal allocation for optimized learning.</li>
<li>It helps you discover your learning style by tracking the types of activities you use to study and keeping track of how well you retain material from them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Toy is being developed as a final project for <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com">Launch Academy</a> by <a href="http://www.krysiacodes.com">Kristin Smith</a>, a former teacher and life-long learner.</p>
