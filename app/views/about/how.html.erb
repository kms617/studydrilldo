<h1>How it Works</h1>
<hl>
<p><strong>study.drill.do</strong> is a learning and productivity tool with two main features:<p>
<ul>
<li>It integrates a common foreign language lesson-planning methodology to optimize study by checking how you study (the allocation of the different tasks you use to study) against an ideal allocation for optimized learning.</li>
<li>It helps you discover your learning style by tracking the types of activities you use to study and keeping track of how well you retain material from them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>study.drill.do</strong> is being developed as a breakable toy (final project) for <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com">Launch Academy</a> by <a href="http://www.krysiacodes.com">Kristin Smith</a>, a former foreign language and ESL teacher.</p>
